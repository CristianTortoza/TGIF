					<h2>About us</h2>
					<p>
						Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, 
						transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the 
						heart of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that
						government should be transparent.
					</p>
					<p>
						Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business
						and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
						allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information 
						for citizens about what their Government is doing.
					</p>	
					<p>
						We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the 
						Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely 
						dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. 
						We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American government.
					</p>
					<p>
						TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit 
						public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.

					<h4>Background History of Government Transparency</h4>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>
							In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public 
							opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack
							on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage 
							of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for 
							example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press 
							legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that
							of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
							public sphere.
						</p>
						<p>
							Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the
							press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in
							constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on 
							these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham,
							Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.
						</p>
						<p>
							Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often 
							linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted
							the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
							eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917,
							passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).
						</p>
						<p>
							The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts
							(AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
						</p>
